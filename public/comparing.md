- not needed the additional resources;
- not needed to install;
- You can custom tune the appearance of dashboards;
- You don't need the additional ip-adresses & domain names for organize access to them(You can view the dashboards on gsp web interface);

##  Prometheus/Grafana stack advantages:

- more user-friendly interfase;
- more built-in features;
- more flexibility(flexible query language);
- dimensional data model;
- beautiful visualizations;
- interactive graphs;

- prometheus supports a broader set of client libraries;

## GSP disadvantages:
